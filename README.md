# ProteinVisualizer

ProteinVisualizer is a React Native application built with Expo that allows users to fetch and visualize protein structure data from the PDB database. The application provides detailed information about the protein, including its ID, molecular weight. Users can also download the PDB data locally.

## Features

- Fetch protein data from the PDB database using a PDB ID.
- Display detailed protein information, including compound structure data, molecular weight, and experimental details.
- Download PDB data locally to the device.

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ProteinVisualizer.git
   cd ProteinVisualizer
   ```

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
